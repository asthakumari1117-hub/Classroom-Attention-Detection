## ⏱️ Study-Time Monitoring (Live Camera Mode)

ClassWatch AI includes a study-purpose live camera feature to monitor
student attention during study sessions.

### How it Works:
- The camera turns ON when the study session starts
- The student studies in front of the camera
- After **5 minutes**, the system automatically captures an image
- The captured image is analyzed using Azure Custom Vision
- The system detects whether the student is:
  - Focused (Studying)
  - Sleeping
  - Looking Away


This feature helps in monitoring continuous student engagement during
self-study or classroom study time.
