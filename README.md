# Classroom Attention Detection using Azure Custom Vision

## 📌 Overview
This project detects student attention levels in classroom images using Microsoft Azure Custom Vision.
The system classifies students into Focused, Looking Away, and Sleeping categories.

## 🎯 Objective
- Monitor student attention in classrooms
- Assist teachers in understanding engagement levels
- Demonstrate cloud-based image classification

## 🧠 Technology Stack
- Azure Custom Vision
- Image Classification (Multiclass)
- Kaggle Classroom Dataset
- Azure Prediction API

## 🗂 Dataset
Kaggle Classroom Dataset:

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Collected classroom images
2. Manually tagged images into three classes
3. Trained a multiclass classification model
4. Evaluated using Precision, Recall, and AP
5. Deployed the model using Azure Prediction API

## 📊 Results
- Precision: 100%
- Recall: 100%
- Average Precision (AP): 100%

## 🚀 Deployment
The trained model is deployed using Azure Custom Vision Prediction API and provides real-time predictions for uploaded images.

## 🔮 Future Scope
